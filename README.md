*Inspired by [YTVimeoExtractor](https://github.com/lilfaf/YTVimeoExtractor) for iOS.*

### Add to project 

To use this library, simply add JitPack as a repository source in your `build.gradle` at the end of the repositories section:

```groovy
repositories {
   // ...
   maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
}
```

Step 2: Add the dependency to your dependency list and replace ending with latest version

```groovy
dependencies {
    // ...
    compile 'com.github.ed-george:AndroidVimeoExtractor:<latest-version>'
}
```

That's it!
NOTE: To get the latest version visit [this link](https://jitpack.io/#ed-george/AndroidVimeoExtractor)

### Usage

**Requires Minimum SDK 9 - Android 2.3**

Video information can be extracted from an identifier:

```java
VimeoExtractor.getInstance().fetchVideoWithIdentifier("1234", null, new OnVimeoExtractionListener() {
            @Override
            public void onSuccess(VimeoVideo video) {
                String hdStream = video.getStreams().get("1080p");
                //...
            }

            @Override
            public void onFailure(Throwable throwable) {
                //Error handling here
            }
});
```

Or alternatively from a full video url:

```java
VimeoExtractor.getInstance().fetchVideoWithURL("https://vimeo.com/1234", null, new OnVimeoExtractionListener() {
            @Override
            public void onSuccess(VimeoVideo video) {
                String hdStream = video.getStreams().get("1080p");
                //...
            }

            @Override
            public void onFailure(Throwable throwable) {
                //Error handling here
            }
});
```
Please build and read the documentation for a better oversight of the information available from each video.

#### Private Videos

When requesting information on private videos - pass the referrer parameter as `null`, this will ensure the default header is sent and should avoid any HTTP 403 Forbidden errors.
